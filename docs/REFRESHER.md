# What I Built & What's Next

A personal refresher for when you come back to this project after a break.

## What You Built

Claude Academy is a complete interactive learning website for mastering Claude and Claude Code. It has 74 lessons across 13 modules organized in 4 skill arcs (Foundation, Practitioner, Power User, Expert), 294 quiz questions, interactive exercises, light/dark mode (dark default), and it's deployed to 2 platforms. It has an optional Supabase backend for authentication (email, Google, GitHub), cross-device progress sync, a public leaderboard, and completion certificates. The site works fully without a backend -- Supabase adds user accounts and sync on top.

---

## How It Works

- You write lessons as MDX files in `content/modules/`. Each module has a `_module.json` for metadata and numbered `.mdx` files for lessons.
- Push to `main` and the pipeline kicks in: lint, typecheck, unit tests, E2E tests, security scan, then auto-deploys to both GitHub Pages and Vercel.
- Progress (completed lessons, quiz scores, streaks, achievements) is tracked in the user's browser via localStorage. No accounts needed.
- **Optional auth**: if Supabase env vars are set, users can sign up (email, Google, GitHub) to sync progress across devices, appear on the leaderboard, and earn certificates. Without Supabase, the site runs as a fully static app.
- Logged-in users get dual-write: progress saves to both localStorage and Supabase. Guests use localStorage only.
- Vercel deployment uses SSR (for auth callbacks). GitHub Pages deployment uses static export.

## Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # Local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build          # Production build (outputs to /out)
npm test               # Unit tests (46 tests)
npm run test:coverage  # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright E2E tests (36 tests)
npm run lint           # ESLint
git push               # Auto-deploys via pipeline
```

### Supabase Setup (one-time)

```bash
# 1. Copy env template and add your Supabase credentials
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local → set NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# 2. Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor
#    Paste contents of supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql and click Run

# 3. Configure auth redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard:
#    Authentication > URL Configuration > add http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

## How to Add a New Lesson

1. Create `content/modules/XX-name/NN-slug.mdx` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Lesson Title"
   slug: "your-lesson-slug"
   order: 5
   difficulty: "beginner"
   duration: 15
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   objectives:
     - "First learning objective"
     - "Second learning objective"
   quiz:
     - question: "Your quiz question?"
       type: "multiple-choice"
       options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
       correct: 0
       explanation: "Why A is correct"
   ---
   ```
2. Write your lesson content in MDX below the frontmatter. You can embed Quiz, FillInBlank, TerminalSimulator, Callout, CodeBlock, etc.
3. Push to main. The pipeline runs, tests pass, and it auto-deploys.

---

## How to Add a New Module

1. Create `content/modules/XX-name/_module.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Your Module",
     "slug": "your-module",
     "description": "What this module covers",
     "arc": "foundation",
     "order": 14,
     "icon": "brain",
     "color": "#5cb870",
     "estimatedHours": 2,
     "prerequisites": [],
     "lessonCount": 5
   }
   ```
2. Add lessons as MDX files in the same directory.
3. Update `src/lib/constants.ts` -- add your module slug to the `MODULE_ORDER` array.
4. Push to main. It auto-deploys.

## Architecture Decisions (Why We Did It This Way)

Quick reference to key decisions. Full details in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Section 12) and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Section 4).

1. **Static-first (no backend)** -- Zero hosting cost, instant page loads, maximum privacy. All user data stays in the browser. Adding a backend later only requires swapping the Zustand persist storage adapter (~50 lines of code).

2. **MDX for lessons** -- Authors write Markdown and can embed React components (Quiz, FillInBlank, TerminalSimulator) directly in the content. Content is version-controlled in Git. No CMS dependency.

3. **Zustand + localStorage** -- Zustand is 2KB gzipped with built-in persist middleware. One line of config gives you localStorage persistence. No Redux boilerplate, no database needed.

4. **data-testid for testing** -- Stable selectors that survive UI redesigns, text changes, and DOM restructuring. Page object locators use `page.getByTestId()` exclusively, so tests never break when you change CSS classes or copy.

5. **Page Object Model for E2E** -- Each page has a corresponding class in `e2e/pages/`. When the UI changes, you update one page object instead of every test that touches that page. Tests read like user stories.

6. **Dual deploy (GitHub Pages + Vercel)** -- Redundancy: if one platform has issues, the other is still up. Different audiences can use different URLs. GitHub Pages is free and tied to the repo; Vercel gives you preview deploys on PRs.

7. **4 separate CI workflows** -- Separation of concerns. CI runs on every push. Security scans run on pushes and weekly. Deploy only runs on main. PR previews only run on PRs. Each workflow has minimal permissions.

---

## If Something Breaks

1. **Check the pipeline**: https://github.com/Khader9Jber/claude-academy/actions
   - Look at the most recent workflow run. Red means failure -- click into it to see which job failed and read the logs.

2. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000 and check if it works.

3. **Check types**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   This catches TypeScript errors that ESLint might miss.

4. **Check lint**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test              # Unit tests
   npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests (needs dev server running or will auto-start one)
   ```

6. **Check coverage**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
   If coverage drops below 90% statements, the CI will fail. Check `coverage/index.html` for a detailed report.

7. **Common issues**:
   - "Module not found" -- check that the module slug is in `MODULE_ORDER` in `src/lib/constants.ts`
   - "Build fails" -- run `npm run build` locally and read the error. Usually a TypeScript error or missing content file.
   - "E2E test fails" -- check `playwright-report/index.html` for screenshots and traces. The most common cause is a missing `data-testid` on a new element.
   - "Deploy fails" -- check that `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets are set in the repo settings.

## Snapshots & Reverting

The project uses Git tags as snapshots. If a major change breaks things, you can revert.

```bash
git tag -l                    # List all snapshots
git reset --hard v0.1.0       # Revert to static-only version (no backend)
git push --force              # Push revert (destructive — use with caution)
```

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `v0.1.0` | Static site, no backend, dark mode only |
| `v0.2.0` | Supabase backend + light/dark mode support |
