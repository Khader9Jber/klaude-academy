## 2. Content Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
content/
  modules/
    XX-slug/                    # Module directory (XX = 01-99, slug = kebab-case)
      _module.json              # Module metadata (required)
      NN-slug.mdx               # Lesson file (NN = 01-99, slug = kebab-case)
```

- Modules are ordered by the `XX` prefix in the directory name.
- Lessons within a module are ordered by the `NN` prefix in the filename.
- The `_module.json` file is required for every module.

### MDX Frontmatter Schema

Every lesson MDX file starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Lesson Title Here"              # Required. Human-readable title.
slug: "lesson-slug-here"                # Required. URL slug (kebab-case). Must be unique within the module.
order: 1                                # Required. Display order within the module (matches NN prefix).
difficulty: "beginner"                  # Required. One of: "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced", "expert"
duration: 15                            # Required. Estimated reading time in minutes.
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]                  # Required. Array of lowercase tags for search/filtering.
objectives:                             # Required. Array of learning objectives (2-4 items).
  - "First learning objective"
  - "Second learning objective"
quiz:                                   # Optional but strongly recommended. Array of quiz questions.
  - id: "unique-quiz-id"               #   Required. Unique identifier (module-prefix + number).
    question: "The question text?"      #   Required. The question.
    type: "multiple-choice"             #   Required. Currently only "multiple-choice" is supported.
    options:                            #   Required. Array of 4 answer options.
      - "Option A"
      - "Option B"
      - "Option C"
      - "Option D"
    correct: 1                          #   Required. Zero-indexed correct answer (0-3).
    explanation: "Why this is correct"  #   Required. Explanation shown after answering.
---
```

### Quiz Question Format

- Each lesson should have **3-5 quiz questions** (standard is 4).
- Questions use zero-indexed `correct` field (0 = first option, 3 = last option).
- The `id` field must be globally unique. Convention: `module-prefix-number` (e.g., `hooks-1`, `batch-2`).
- Explanations should teach, not just confirm -- explain WHY the answer is correct.
- Module quiz lessons (like `02-prompt-engineering/08-quiz.mdx`) can have 10-12 questions for comprehensive assessment.

### Module Metadata Format (_module.json)

```json
{
  "title": "Module Title",             // Required. Human-readable name.
  "slug": "module-slug",               // Required. Must match MODULE_ORDER entry in constants.ts.
  "description": "What this module covers in 1-2 sentences.",  // Required.
  "arc": "foundation",                 // Required. One of: "foundation", "practitioner", "power-user", "expert"
  "order": 1,                          // Required. Global display order (1-99).
  "icon": "brain",                     // Required. Lucide icon name.
  "color": "#5cb870",                  // Required. Hex color matching the arc.
  "estimatedHours": 2,                 // Required. Total estimated hours for all lessons.
  "prerequisites": [],                 // Required. Array of prerequisite module slugs (can be empty).
  "lessonCount": 4                     // Required. Number of MDX lesson files in this module.
}
```

**Arc colors:**
- Foundation: `#5cb870` (green)
- Practitioner: `#5e9ed6` (blue)
- Power User: `#a07ed6` (purple)
- Expert: `#d4a053` (gold)

### How Modules Map to Arcs

The mapping is defined in two places:

1. **`_module.json`:** Each module's `arc` field declares which arc it belongs to.
2. **`src/lib/constants.ts`:** `ARC_DEFINITIONS` defines the arcs and their display properties. Each arc has an `id`, `name`, `color`, `description`, and `range` (human-readable module range).

Current mapping:
- Foundation: Modules 1-4 (claude-fundamentals, prompt-engineering, claude-code-basics, commands-and-navigation)
- Practitioner: Modules 5-8 (claude-md-and-config, session-and-context, git-and-workflows, mcp-fundamentals)
- Power User: Modules 9-11 (hooks-and-automation, agents-and-skills, advanced-workflows)
- Expert: Modules 12-13 (enterprise-and-production, capstone)

### How MODULE_ORDER Controls Display

`src/lib/constants.ts` exports a `MODULE_ORDER` array of module slugs:

```typescript
export const MODULE_ORDER: string[] = [
  "claude-fundamentals",
  "prompt-engineering",
  "claude-code-basics",
  "commands-and-navigation",
  "claude-md-and-config",
  "session-and-context",
  "git-and-workflows",
  "mcp-fundamentals",
  "hooks-and-automation",
  "agents-and-skills",
  "advanced-workflows",
  "enterprise-and-production",
  "capstone",
];
```

This array determines the order modules appear on the curriculum page. The content loader (`src/lib/content.ts`) uses this array to sort modules. **If a module's slug is not in this array, it will not appear on the site.**

---

## 3. Content Style Guide

### Writing Tone and Voice

- **Direct and practical.** Write as a senior engineer teaching a capable colleague, not as a textbook.
- **Second person ("you").** "When you start a new session..." not "When a user starts..."
- **Confident assertions.** "This is the single most impactful thing you can add" not "This might be helpful."
- **Opinionated when warranted.** Give clear recommendations rather than listing every option.
- **Real frustrations acknowledged.** "Here's a truth that trips up every new Claude user..." builds trust.

### Lesson Structure

Every lesson follows this structure:

1. **Frontmatter** -- title, slug, order, difficulty, duration, tags, objectives, quiz
2. **Opening hook** -- 2-3 paragraphs that establish WHY this topic matters. Lead with a problem the reader has experienced.
3. **Core content** -- Teach the concept with:
   - Clear explanations
   - Code examples (realistic, not toy examples)
   - Before/after comparisons when applicable
   - ASCII diagrams for architecture concepts
   - Tables for reference information
4. **Practical application** -- Show how to use what was taught in a real workflow.
5. **Key Takeaway** -- A single paragraph (4-6 sentences) that summarizes the lesson's core message. Always the final section. Always uses the h2 heading `## Key Takeaway`.

### Code Example Standards

- Always include a language annotation on fenced code blocks: ````typescript`, ````bash`, ````json`, ````yaml`, ````markdown`
- Use realistic examples from plausible projects, not `foo`/`bar`/`baz`.
- Keep code blocks focused. Show the relevant part, not an entire file.
- Use comments in code to explain non-obvious lines.
- For CLI examples, show both the command and representative output where helpful.
- For configuration examples (JSON, YAML), show complete, copy-pasteable snippets.

### Quiz Question Standards

- **3-5 questions per lesson** (4 is the standard, 3 is the minimum).
- **4 options per question** (multiple-choice only).
- **Explanation is mandatory** for every question -- explanations should teach.
- One clearly correct answer. Distractors should be plausible but clearly wrong upon reflection.
- Questions should test understanding, not memorization of trivia.
- At least one question per lesson should test application (not just recall).

### Heading Hierarchy

- **h2 (`##`)** for major sections within the lesson body. The lesson title comes from frontmatter, not an h1 in the content.
- **h3 (`###`)** for subsections within a major section.
- **h4 (`####`)** sparingly, for items within a subsection (e.g., individual hook events).
- Never use h1 (`#`) in lesson content -- it is reserved for the rendered lesson title.

### Length Targets

- **Minimum:** 800 words per lesson
- **Target:** 1200-1500 words per lesson
- **Maximum:** 2000 words per lesson (split into two lessons if longer)
- **Module quiz lessons** are an exception -- can be shorter (500-800 words) since the quiz itself is the content.

### Formatting Conventions

- **Bold** for key terms on first mention (e.g., **Constitutional AI (CAI)**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**).
- **Italics** for emphasis on single words or short phrases.
- **Inline code** for file paths, command names, function names, config keys, and short code references.
- Use tables for reference material (command lists, comparison charts, event catalogs).
- Use blockquotes sparingly -- prefer Callout components for tips/warnings.

### Technical Accuracy Requirements

- All content must be accurate for Claude Code v2.1+ (current stable).
- When Claude Code features change in a new release, affected lessons must be updated.
- Code examples must work as written -- no pseudocode in code blocks (pseudocode goes in plain text).
- If a feature is experimental or in beta, mark it clearly.

## 4. Content Quality Tiers

### Tier 1 -- Production-Ready

Deep, specific, hand-crafted content with realistic examples. These lessons are the gold standard.

| Module | Lessons | Why Tier 1 |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 01 -- Claude Fundamentals | All 4 | Clear explanations of foundational concepts, accessible to beginners |
| 02 -- Prompt Engineering | All 8 | The strongest module. Detailed before/after examples, 12-question module quiz, realistic code scenarios |
| 03 -- Claude Code Basics | All 5 | Practical, step-by-step hands-on content |
| 05 -- CLAUDE.md and Config | All 6 | Excellent templates, complete with testing instructions, production patterns |
| 08 -- MCP Fundamentals | All 5 | Strong architecture diagrams, unique token cost analysis, clear client-server explanation |
| 12 -- Enterprise (lessons 1-2, 4) | 3 of 7 | Custom MCP server lesson has a complete TypeScript implementation |
| 13 -- Capstone (lesson 1) | 1 of 4 | Agentic systems has excellent architecture pattern diagrams |

### Tier 2 -- Good

Solid structure and content, but could benefit from more specific examples, richer scenarios, or additional quiz questions.

| Module | Lessons | What to Improve |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| 04 -- Commands and Navigation | All 5 | Add more workflow-oriented examples; currently reference-heavy |
| 06 -- Session and Context | All 5 | Add concrete token budget calculations and before/after compaction examples |
| 07 -- Git and Workflows | All 6 | Git workflows lesson needs more complex branching scenarios |
| 09 -- Hooks and Automation | All 5 | Add end-to-end automation pipeline examples beyond individual hooks |
| 10 -- Agents and Skills | All 7 | Add complete, copy-pasteable skill and agent templates |
| 11 -- Advanced Workflows | All 7 | Lessons 2-4 have only 3 quiz questions each (below standard of 4) |
| 12 -- Enterprise (lessons 3, 5-7) | 4 of 7 | Enterprise patterns and monitoring need real org-level case studies |
| 13 -- Capstone (lessons 2-4) | 3 of 4 | Could use more guided project walkthroughs |

### Tier 3 -- Needs Enrichment

No module falls entirely into Tier 3. However, the REFRESHER.md notes that "lessons 50-100 have more templated content than lessons 1-20." The later lessons in modules 9-13 trend toward Tier 2 and would benefit most from enrichment passes focused on specific examples and code depth.

## 7. How to Add New Content

### 7.1 Adding a New Lesson

**Step 1:** Decide which module it belongs to. Check the module list in Section 1 above.

**Step 2:** Determine the lesson number. Look at existing files in the module directory and pick the next number:
```bash
ls content/modules/XX-module-name/
# Example output: 01-first.mdx  02-second.mdx  03-third.mdx  _module.json
# Your new lesson would be: 04-your-slug.mdx
```

**Step 3:** Create the MDX file. Copy this complete template:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Lesson Title"
slug: "your-lesson-slug"
order: 4
difficulty: "intermediate"
duration: 15
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
objectives:
  - "First learning objective"
  - "Second learning objective"
  - "Third learning objective"
quiz:
  - id: "prefix-1"
    question: "First quiz question?"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    options:
      - "Option A"
      - "Option B (correct)"
      - "Option C"
      - "Option D"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Explanation of why B is correct and what the student should learn from this."
  - id: "prefix-2"
    question: "Second quiz question?"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    options:
      - "Option A"
      - "Option B"
      - "Option C (correct)"
      - "Option D"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Explanation of why C is correct."
  - id: "prefix-3"
    question: "Third quiz question?"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    options:
      - "Option A (correct)"
      - "Option B"
      - "Option C"
      - "Option D"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Explanation of why A is correct."
  - id: "prefix-4"
    question: "Fourth quiz question?"
    type: "multiple-choice"
    options:
      - "Option A"
      - "Option B"
      - "Option C"
      - "Option D (correct)"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "Explanation of why D is correct."

## Opening Hook

Start with 2-3 paragraphs that establish WHY this topic matters. Lead with a problem.

## Core Concept

Teach the main concept here. Use code examples:

```typescript
// Realistic code example
const result = await doSomething();
```

## Practical Application

Show how to use this in a real workflow.

## Key Takeaway

A single paragraph (4-6 sentences) that summarizes the lesson's core message.
```

**Step 4:** Write the content following the style guide (Section 3).

**Step 5:** Update `_module.json` -- increment the `lessonCount` field:
```json
{
  "lessonCount": 5  // was 4, now 5
}
```

**Step 6:** Verify the build:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

**Step 7:** Push to main. The CI/CD pipeline runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, and E2E tests, then auto-deploys to Netlify, GitHub Pages, and Vercel.

---

### 7.2 Adding a New Module

**Step 1:** Choose a module number and slug. Use the next available number:
```bash
ls content/modules/
# If the last module is 13-capstone, your new module is 14-your-module
```

**Step 2:** Create the module directory:
```bash
mkdir content/modules/14-your-module
```

**Step 3:** Create `_module.json`:
```json
{
  "title": "Your Module Title",
  "slug": "your-module",
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence description of what this module covers.",
  "arc": "practitioner",
  "order": 14,
  "icon": "brain",
  "color": "#5e9ed6",
  "estimatedHours": 3,
  "prerequisites": ["mcp-fundamentals"],
  "lessonCount": 5
}
```

**Step 4:** Add lessons as MDX files (see 7.1 above).

**Step 5:** Update `src/lib/constants.ts` -- add your module slug to the `MODULE_ORDER` array:
```typescript
export const MODULE_ORDER: string[] = [
  // ... existing modules ...
  "capstone",
  "your-module",  // Add here
];
```

**Important:** The position in `MODULE_ORDER` determines display order. Place new modules in the appropriate position relative to their arc.

**Step 6:** If the module is in a new position within an existing arc, update the `range` field in `ARC_DEFINITIONS` in `src/lib/constants.ts`.

**Step 7:** Verify and push:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
git push origin main
```

---

### 7.3 Adding a New Arc

**Step 1:** Add the arc definition to `src/lib/constants.ts`:
```typescript
export const ARC_DEFINITIONS: ArcDefinition[] = [
  // ... existing arcs ...
  {
    id: "specialist",
    name: "Specialist Tracks",
    color: "#e06c75",
    description: "Apply your Claude skills to specific domains.",
    range: "Modules 17-21",
  },
];
```

**Step 2:** Create modules for the new arc (see 7.2 above). Each module's `_module.json` should have `"arc": "specialist"`.

**Step 3:** Add all module slugs to `MODULE_ORDER` in the appropriate position.

**Step 4:** Update the curriculum page if it has any arc-specific rendering logic. Check `src/app/curriculum/` for hardcoded arc references.

**Step 5:** Choose an arc color that doesn't conflict with existing arcs:
- Foundation: `#5cb870` (green)
- Practitioner: `#5e9ed6` (blue)
- Power User: `#a07ed6` (purple)
- Expert: `#d4a053` (gold)
- Specialist: `#e06c75` (red/coral) -- suggested

**Step 6:** Build, test, push.

## 10. Arabic Content Roadmap

### Vision

Translate Klaude Academy into Arabic to serve Arabic-speaking developers. This requires both content translation and significant technical work for RTL (right-to-left) layout support.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) -- Module 1 Only

**Goal:** Translate Module 1 (Claude Fundamentals, 4 lessons) and validate the RTL infrastructure.

**Technical requirements:**
- Install and configure `next-intl` for internationalization
- Add Arabic locale files and routing (`/ar/` prefix)
- Implement RTL CSS support:
  - `dir="rtl"` on the HTML element for Arabic pages
  - Logical CSS properties (`margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left`)
  - RTL-aware Tailwind classes (`rtl:` modifier)
- Add Arabic web fonts: Cairo (for headings) and Tajawal (for body text)
- Add a language switcher component in the navigation
- Test RTL rendering for all components: lesson content, quiz cards, progress indicators, navigation

**Content work:**
- Translate all 4 lessons in Module 1
- Translate the module's `_module.json` metadata
- Review translations with a native Arabic technical writer
- Test quiz questions in Arabic (ensure answer options render correctly in RTL)

**File structure:**
```
content/
  modules/
    01-claude-fundamentals/
      _module.json              # English (default)
      _module.ar.json           # Arabic metadata
      01-what-is-claude.mdx     # English
      01-what-is-claude.ar.mdx  # Arabic
```

### Phase 2: Rest of Foundation (Weeks 5-10)

**Goal:** Translate Modules 2-4 (Prompt Engineering, Claude Code Basics, Commands and Navigation).

- 19 additional lessons to translate
- Prompt Engineering module requires careful translation -- code examples stay in English, but explanations and quiz questions must be in natural Arabic
- Commands and Navigation requires RTL-aware keyboard shortcut displays

### Phase 3: Practitioner Arc (Weeks 11-18)

**Goal:** Translate Modules 5-8 (CLAUDE.md and Config, Session and Context, Git and Workflows, MCP Fundamentals).

- 22 additional lessons
- Configuration examples (JSON, YAML) stay in English -- only descriptions and explanations are translated
- MCP architecture diagrams need RTL-compatible ASCII art or SVG alternatives

### Phase 4: Remaining Modules (Weeks 19-28)

**Goal:** Translate Modules 9-13 (Power User and Expert arcs).

- 30 additional lessons
- Enterprise content may need localization beyond translation (region-specific compliance info)
- Capstone project descriptions should reference tools available in the MENA region

### Technical Checklist for Arabic Support

- [ ] `next-intl` installed and configured
- [ ] Arabic locale routing (`/ar/` prefix)
- [ ] RTL CSS with logical properties
- [ ] Cairo and Tajawal fonts loaded
- [ ] Language switcher component
- [ ] RTL-aware navigation and sidebar
- [ ] RTL-aware quiz components
- [ ] RTL-aware progress indicators
- [ ] RTL-aware code blocks (code stays LTR, labels/titles in RTL)
- [ ] Translated UI strings (buttons, labels, navigation)
- [ ] Arabic SEO metadata (title, description, OG tags)
- [ ] Arabic 404 and error pages
